# Contributing

We welcome pull requests on this project.  However, due to funding constraints, there is no guarantee that pull requests will be merged with the main line code or even reviewed. We will do the best we can.

To contribute: fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/sbmt-util.git
```

Make your changes, and push them to your fork.  Then submit a pull request.

Things that will help increase that your pull request is reviewed and accepted:

- Write tests (and make sure they pass!)
- Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
